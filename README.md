All data could be attribute to a specific user by cascading foreign key conatraint between several kinds of id in each table.

1   SQL error or missing database

2   Internal error in SQLite

3   Access denied

4   database is locked

5   A table in the database is locked

Temperature, blood pressure, pulse, oximeter, weight and Glucometer is included as well as primary information of users and devices.
Unit test has been done in 



./Djtest/test0/test1.py.



The example of sending data is shown in

Restful system is developed via Django. 

The API contains the functions of login, a restful port with the function of GET PUT DELETE POST of the existing database and get json response. All basic and GET function could be easily entered by Microsoft edge and the function of POST, PUT, DELETE are tested on postman. all results could be see in the

Iâ€˜ll prefer document database for the chat module (Mongle.db) for seceral reasons:

First, the content of the chatting information is diverse, there may be words, pictures, syntax that ia not easy to forsee

and considered at the time when structure is designed, which is ecpected to ruled for a long time.

Second, the demand of constrain are not that strict and most information stored are based on timeflow, the rarely simple linear structure.
