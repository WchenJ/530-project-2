Iâ€˜ll prefer sql database for the chat module for seceral reasons:

First, the content of the chatting information is diverse, there may be words, pictures, syntax that ia not easy to forsee

and considered at the time when structure is designed, which is ecpected to ruled for a long time.

Second, the demand of constrain are not that strict and most information stored are based on timeflow, the rarely simple linear structure.

Chat Module

The user of chat moudle needs to receive the message from the talking parterners, send message to the parterners and store the records.

The Module support sending, receiving and storing based on Sqlite3. A database will be created for a chatroom .  Parterners can send and check the talking content.
